# CoronaVirus-Tracker
This repository is a mini project for Tracking Corona virus using Coronavirus COVID-19 Data. A dash board has been created which shows number of reported cases, deaths and recovered cases followed by detailed description of geography wise information. I used Java, Spring Boot, Thymleaf for building the application.
